# Movie Project Website
Creates a website of movies that plays the trailer when the poster is clicked on

## Libraries used
* fresh_tomatoes.py
Creates the website and formatting of the movies displayed
* media.py
Contains the movie class; This is how instances of the movie class is created. (In other words, this is what allows us to add movies to the website.)

## How-to open the website
* Open the movies.py file
This is where all the movies are contained
* Build, or run, the project
 
## How-to add movies
Movies are created by inserting the variables in the following order:
* Name: the title of the movie
* Storyline: the description of the movie
* Poster: use the link of the poster url
* trailer: use the linke of where the trailer will be played, preferrably youtube

## Current Bugs
When the website is enlarged enough to make a list of movies by rows of three, after every third movie, the following row will only contain one movie at the end of the row.

As of now, I am not able to figure out how to fix this, despite using the default fresh_tomatoes code.
